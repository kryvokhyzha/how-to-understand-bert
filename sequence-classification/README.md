# Sequence classification ðŸ’¡
There you can find some notebooks with examples of usage BERT for sequence classification.

## Notebooks
+ **bert-fine-tuning-sentence-classification.ipynb** - this tutorial shows how to use BERT with the huggingface PyTorch library to quickly and efficiently fine-tune a model to get near state of the art performance in sentence classification. [Original notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pTuQhug6Dhl9XalKB0zUGf4FIdYFlpcX).
